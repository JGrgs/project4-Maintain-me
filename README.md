# Maintain-Me

![Weekendr Homepage](https://i.imgur.com/MAmHQDm.png)

Maintain-Me is an app that helps you log and track all your vehicle's maintenance schedules. Never be overdue on your oil changes again. All you have to do is log in the type of maintenance, the due date/ due at (miles) and as the app is still under development, we will have an email feature that reminds you that your due date/ due at (miles) is nearing. The app also includes a map that, based on the user's location given on sign up, pinpoints all the mechanics around the user.

### Approach

### Unresolved Issues

- The map isn't fully mobile responsive yet.
- Have a different marker icon for the user's location.
